# Links Chrome Extension

## Description
As a guided project in the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program, I developed a Chrome extension named "Links". The extension is designed to save the current tab's link so users can easily revisit it later. This project introduced me to the basics of creating browser extensions and managing browser-specific APIs.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Understanding the structure and components of a Chrome extension.
- Using browser API `chrome.tabs` to interact with the browser's tab system.
- Implementing persistent data storage to save and retrieve links.
- Developing and testing a browser extension in a real-world scenario.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`, and enable "Developer mode".
3. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the cloned extension directory.
4. Use the extension from the Chrome toolbar to save and access tab links.

## Demo
This project is a Chrome extension and does not have a live web page. To test the extension, follow the setup instructions to install it on your Chrome browser.
